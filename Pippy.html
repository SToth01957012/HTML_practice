  <h1>Meet Pippy üê±</h1>
  <p>Pippy is a calico cat with striking green eyes. She's slightly less than graceful, clingy, and enjoys shouting at you to pay attention to her. But her favorite spot to snuggle 
    is on the closest lap she can find, or at the very least, next to it. She loves meeting new people and receiving all their attention but dispises being left alone.</p>
  
    <ul>
    <li>Breed: American Shorthair</li>
    <li>Age: 7 years</li>
    <li>Favorite toy: bottle caps</li>
    <li>Weird habit: Will scream at you to pay attention to her even when making direct eye contact</li>
  </ul>
